## My Customization & Learning Journey

I forked Automatisch to deepen my understanding of workflow automation with Node.js, React, and Tailwind.

**What I did:**

- Deployed a local instance and explored its real-time workflow builder.
- Added detailed usage notes to help new users set up and run the project smoothly.
- Documented troubleshooting tips and my learning process.
- Customized the UI theme colors slightly to improve contrast and accessibility.

This project helped me learn key concepts like:
- Event-driven backend with Node.js
- React state management with Zustand
- Tailwind CSS utility-first styling
- Real-time communication using WebSockets
